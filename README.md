# Hypertext-Garden

## Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a platform for my experiments in hypertext gardening.

My hope is to create a web "experience" in the same way that the early Internet felt like an "experience" - stumbling through loosely ranked links to explore the machinations of enterprising tinkerers.

As opposed to the experience of ranked search and highly structured websites, a hypertext garden can inspire a sense of mystery and curiosity.
